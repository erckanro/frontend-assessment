## Exercise 2
Read the `data.json` file and display the data as tabs on desktop and an accordion on mobile.

```bash
Requirements:

Display data in tabs on desktop.
Display data in an accordion on mobile.
Only 1 accordion/tab should be open at a time.
Open the first accordion/tab on load.

```
#### Bonus points
- Improve the user experience with meaningful animations/transitions.

- Design and styling.

- Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

```bash
'b' + 'a': This concatenates the strings 'b' + 'a'  = 'ba'

+'a': The unary plus operator tries to convert the string 'a' to a number, it becomes NaN (Not a Number) = 'NaN'

+'a' = 'a'

baNaNa.toLowerCase() = banana
```
